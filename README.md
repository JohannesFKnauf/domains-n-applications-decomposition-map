# Domains 'n' Applications Decomposition Map App

## Input data

The DnA decomposition map expects its input as a text of dot-separated domain / application names. See [example.dsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohannesFKnauf/domains-n-applications-decomposition-map/master/example.dsv) for an example.

There is no semantic interpretation of the data. The typical use is to reserve all levels but the last for domains / subdomains and use the leaf for the application name.

However, nothing prevents you to e.g. introduce a nesting inside the applications for individual features or components.
